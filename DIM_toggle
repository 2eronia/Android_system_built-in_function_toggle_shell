# DIM on
settings put secure reduce_bright_colors_activated 1

# DIM off
settings put secure reduce_bright_colors_activated 0


# corresponding to FPS_toggle
# though you can set the "secure reduce_bright_colors_activated" to 1/0 to toggle DIM on/off
# on my device, I cannot access the current value of it

# if you wanna make a toggle switch
# try to use Xposed Edge's "Set variable" and "Condition"
